We don't actually know who wrote the gospels. Any of them. The Gospels themselves never actually state who is writing them. The names that we have for the Gospels today were added sometime around 150 AD, several decades after they are assumed to have been written. So we know that the authors of the gospels were not eyewitnesses to the events described in the Gospels.

We also know just contextually that the authors were not writing down events that they witnessed. For example the story of the Temptation of Jesus in Matthew 4, we have a private dialogue between Jesus and Satan. There was no one present to record that interaction, and the person who wrote Matthew was writing nearly 100 years after the story was said to have taken place. Where did the author of Matthew get the dialogue for this section of the book? Where did any of the Gospel writers get their dialogue, stories, and events? They never claim to be retelling the story of any witnesses to the actual events.

We don't actually know when these gospels were written either. The earliest gospel, Mark, is assumed to have been written around 70 AD, but that's really just a guess based on the author's apparent knowledge of The Jewish Wars in Mark 13. The [oldest fragment of Mark](https://www.christianheadlines.com/contributors/michael-foust/oldest-manuscript-of-gospel-of-mark-discovered.html) we have of the book is from late 2nd Century.

This is the central story to Christianity, so I would expect that there is a large amount of strong evidence to back up the claims being made in the Gospels. However, if we don't know who wrote the Gospels; the authors of the Gospels never claim to be witnesses; and the authors were writing, at the earliest, decades after Jesus's execution, then how much confidence can we have that the Gospels are an accurate account of events? Why do the Gospel writers not cite a single source of where they were getting their information?
