I grew up in what I would call a fundamentalist church. The church I grew up in believed in reading the Bible "literally". This meant that the story of Adam and Eve wasn't just a story, but a historical narrative of real human beings who lived some 6,000 to 10,000 years ago. The same was true about Abraham, Noah, the flood, the people who are recorded to have lived for hundreds of years, etc. They were all historical figures who really lived and died many years ago. 

Consequently, this church also had strong opinions about evolution, cosmology, dinosaurs, the age of the Earth, and much more. I remember defending this scientific skepticism throughout high school and even early on in my studies at university. "Scienctists couldn't possibly know what happened thousands or millions of years ago, so there's no need to think about those things much deeper than that." That worked for me for a long time.

Like so many people who have deconstructed their childhood faith before me, my journey started with small little inconsistencies I noticed in how my church was interpretting scripture. It's easy enough to ignore or simply accept that no one is completely consistent, however one by one, these inconsistencies began to add up. I wanted to find answers to these inconsistencies, and my journey started with an earnest desire to find those answers.

After several years of studying, I have to admit that I have come away from the Bible having more questions than I started with. So I have decided to compile my research and study in a single place where I can share with you all what I think are the biggest concerns and lingering questions I have. I've discussed many of these topics with several Preachers, Pastors, Elders, trusted family members, and have yet to find satisfactory answers to my concerns.
