## Acts

## Hebrews

We don't know who wrote Hebrews. Hebrews never states who is writing it. We also don't know when Hebrews was written. An odd point in Hebrews is that it never references anything in the Gospels. It also never references the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem that happened around 70 AD, and in Hebrews 10:1-4, the author makes an argument against temple sacrifices being a worthwhile thing. If the temple had been destroyed at the time of Hebrews' writing, then there wouldn't be any sacrifices and the arguement that the author is making would be pointless.

So this book is actually one of the earlier writings, sometime around 40-60 AD. So it not only predates the Gospels, it also doesn't seem to have any knowledge of any sayings of Jesus or any of the parables.

Why do we trust a book whose authorship we don't know? Why doesn't the author of Hebrews know anything about Jesus' ministry? Why doesn't the author know any common sayings of Jesus or any of the parables? If the stories presented in the Gospels were passed down through oral tradition, then wouldn't the author be intimately familiar with them?
