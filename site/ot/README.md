## Enuma Elish

The [Enuma Elish](https://biologos.org/articles/genesis-1-and-a-babylonian-creation-story/) is a series of tablets recording the Babylonian creation mythology. The dating for the tablets is usually around 1200 BC, but the origin of these stories is thought to predate 1750 BC. (To compare, a historical Moses is usually dated to around 1300 BC).

The Enuma Elish describes the god Marduk cutting open Tiamat thus creating the sky and the earth. However, there remain several similarities with the Bible's creation story.

- Light is created before the sun.
- Describes the waters above being separated from the waters below.
- Darkness is what exists before anything is created

The Enuma Elish was discovered relatively recently (1849) and wasn't publicly published until 1876. Before this discovery, the story in Genesis was thought to be unique in its telling of creation. However since then, archaeologists have discovered several creation myths from nearby civilizations of the same time period that all have similar details.

Why does the Bible's creation story have so much in common with the creation stories of the surrounding societies? Why do creation stories that predate the writing of Genesis and the Hebrew people have so much in common with the Bible's creation story?
