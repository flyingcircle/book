The churches I grew up in would say that they took the Bible "literally". That is to say that every book in the OT was inspired directly by God, meaning that every word is to be treated as if the words were written by God himself. Therefor, anything said in it must be 100% factually true and is completely coherent to a single theology. Archaeological discoveries in the past 200 years or so have greatly expanded our knowledge of the time of early Israel.

## Enuma Elish

The [Enuma Elish](https://biologos.org/articles/genesis-1-and-a-babylonian-creation-story/) is a series of tablets recording the Babylonian creation mythology. The dating for the tablets is usually around 1200 BC, but the origin of these stories is thought to predate 1750 BC. (To compare, a historical Moses is usually dated to around 1300 BC).

The Enuma Elish describes the god Marduk cutting open Tiamat thus creating the sky and the earth. However, there remain several similarities with the Bible's creation story.

- Light is created before the sun.
- Describes the waters above being separated from the waters below.
- Darkness is what exists before anything is created

The Enuma Elish was discovered relatively recently (1849) and wasn't publicly published until 1876. Before this discovery, the story in Genesis was thought to be unique in its telling of creation. However since then, archaeologists have discovered several creation myths from nearby civilizations of the same time period that all have similar details.

Why does the Bible's creation story have so much in common with the creation stories of the surrounding societies? Why do creation stories that predate the writing of Genesis and the Hebrew people have so much in common with the Bible's creation story?

## Code of Hammurabi

It's taken for granted that the laws written down in the OT in Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy were written by God himself. The laws in the OT are still often quoted today in evangelical circles to get an idea of what God wants or to understand what is good or evil in the eyes of God.

For the Babylonians however, they had their own set of laws. There is a famous set of laws called the [Code of Hammurabi](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/hammurabi) that dates back to about 1900-1600 BC. (Predating the nation of Israel by hundreds years) In 1901, a large portion of the code was discovered. So today we have over 200 laws from the early Babylonians.

However, what quickly become apparent in reading the *Code of Hammurabi* is how much of it lines up with the laws given by God in the OT. For example, here are a pair of passages describing laws surrounding "Goring Oxen"

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Exodus 21:28-32"
  quote="When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox is not to be punished. If, however, that ox has been in the habit of goring, and its owner, though warned, has failed to guard it, and it kills a man or a woman-- the ox shall be stoned and its owner, too, shall be put to death. If ransom is laid upon him, he must pay whatever is laid upon him to redeem his life. So, too, if it gores a minor, male or female, the owner shall be dealt with according to the same rule. But if the ox gores a slave, male or female, he shall pay thirty shekels of silver to the master, and the ox shall be stoned."
/>

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Code of Hammurabi 250-252"
  quote="If an ox gores a man while it is passing through the street, that case no basis for a claim. If a man's ox is a known gorer, and the authorities of his city quarter notify him that it is a known gorer, but he does not blunt its horns or control his ox, and that ox gores to death a member of the upper class, he [the owner] shall give thirty shekes of silver. If it is a man's slave [who is fatally gored], he shall give twenty shekels of silver."
/>

There are obviously some nuances that could be teased out in each of these respective laws. But if God is the author of the OT law, then why does it seem to be derived from the *Code of Hammurabi*?

## Cannanite Conquest

## Jerhico

## Daniel

The book of Daniel is unique among all the books of the Bible in that it is largely written in 2 different languages. Chapters 2-8 are written in Aramaic and the rest of the book is written in Hebrew.

However, despite being named Daniel, this book could not have been written by Daniel himself. The author makes multiple historical errors that someone living at the time would not have made. 

- The book talks about Nebuchadnezzar being exiled at the time, but Nebuchadnezzar was never exiled during his reign. The best that can be assumed is that this is rather a mix up with a later king, Nabonidus, who took a leave of absence. 
- In chapter 5, Belshazzar is listed as the final king of Babylon which is just factually incorrect. 
- There are also Greek loan words used throughout the book. This all seems to point to Daniel having been written during the Greek period, not during the Babylonian exile.

Why does the author of Daniel use words that a person in Babylonian exile would not know? If the author is living in Babylonian exile, Why does the author of Daniel get current events incorrect?
