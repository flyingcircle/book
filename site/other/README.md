## Canon

Some may not know that there are many, many more Christian writings that are not being included in our Bibles today. There were the letters of Church leaders during the first century who were writing at the same time as when the Gospels themselves were being written down for the first time. Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp, and Papias. However, these mens' writings were not included in the Bible. Why is that?

There are also works such as *The Acts of Peter*, which is the only source that mentions Peter requesting to be crucified upside down and arriving in Rome. Despite having been told this information myself, this book, and several others like it were also not included in the canon.

There are also several books in the Bible that were very nearly rejected. Revlation, for instance, was a book that was almost not accepted into the NT. This is a pretty commonly accepted fact even by most Christians. Who decided that these books, almost all of which were written several decades after Christ's death should forever be decided as either "Holy Scripture" or not? Usually we point to the apostles as having a direct line to God as thus what they wrote is Scripture. But how do we determine who decided what was authenticly from the Apostles and what wasn't?

The Bible that Protestants use today weren't officially recognized until the Council of Carthage in 397 AD (though this council also included the Apocrypha). However, this wasn't the only council or church at the time declaring what was and wasn't Scripture. The Church of the East in Persia rejected the books 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation around the year 410. There were several more councils and lists of "accepted books" that have been made over the past 2000 years. These councils would reject books we use today and accept others that are no longer found in our Bibles. The exact Bible that Protestants use today was not decided on until Martin Luther removed certain books from the then accepted Bible in the 1500's, and many churches at the time quickly followed.

So why do we use the books that we use today in the Bible? If we only accept the writings of Apostles, then how can we accept books such as Hebrews that don't even claim apostolic authority? If we accept a larger number of books, then why did we accept the list from Martin Luther and reject every other council's list of accepted books?

Usually Christians will point back to the practices of early first or second century Christians. These Chrisitians almost certainly accepted a larger number of books than we do today, so then why do Christians today not use them? Were the Christians back then incorrect to accept certain books such as the Book of Enoch, Tobit, Maccabbees, etc.? What is the foundation being used for believing in the Protestant Bible is correct over other versions of the Christian Bible?
