## Pastorals

The books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus are sometimes referred to as the "Pastorals" of Paul since the tone of the letters is much more personal compared to his other letters. However, scholarship over the past 100 years has noticed a couple of troubling facts about the pastorals. The vocabulary of used in the Pastoral letters doesn't line up with the rest of Paul's letters. Statistical analyses done on the vocabulary used among all of Paul's letters shows that the pastorals simply don't line up with the rest of Paul's letters.

  quote="...there are 848 different words used in the pastoral letters. Of that number 306 over one-third of them! do not occur in any of the other Pauline letters of the New Testament. That's an inordinately high number; especially given the fact that about two-thirds of these 306 words are used by Christian authors living in the second cenury."

So not only is the vocabulary in the Pastorals significantly different from the rest of Paul's letters, the vocabulary being used also lines up with the vocabulary that was being used by second century Christians, nearly 100 years after Paul's death.

Perhaps Paul's change in vocabulary is not a big enough difference to definitively say that someone else may have written the pastorals. But consider the difference in theology between these letters and the rest of Paul's letters:

1. In Paul's epistles, Paul uses the term "works of the law" to refer to following Jewish law: circumcision, dietary laws, etc. However, this use of "works" is no where to be seen in the Pastorals. Here Paul uses "works" as simply doing good deeds and being a morally good person.
2. In his Corinthian letters, Paul says that it is better to remain single and that being single means that someone can better dedicate themselves to God. However, in the Pastorals, Paul now says that marriage is preferable and that all church leaders should be married. And he specifically says that young widows should marry.

<ScriptureQuote 
  reference="1 Corinthians 7:8"
  quote="To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am."
/>

<ScriptureQuote 
  reference="1 Timothy 5:14"
  quote="So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander."
/>

3. Paul speaks about everyone being in equal in Christ and women praying, prophesying, and receiving gifts in Corinthians, but then the pastorals appear to say the opposite in maintaining a male hierarchy and reducing the role of women in the church. In fact, Paul never speaks about a church hierarchy at all in his epistles, but then in the Pastorals, maintaining and defining the church hierarchy seems to be the main purpose of the letter.

Why is the vocabulary so radically different in the Pastorals compared to the rest of Paul's writing? Why do the Pastoral letters' vocabulary line up more with later second century voacbulary? Why does the theology between Paul's other epistles and the pastorals not line up as a single coherent theology? What other reasonable conclusion is possible here other than to say that Paul didn't write 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus?
