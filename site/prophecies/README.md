<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Deuteronomy 18:21-22"
  quote="But you may wonder, ‘How will we know whether or not a prophecy is from the Lord?’ If the prophet speaks in the Lord’s name but his prediction does not happen or come true, you will know that the Lord did not give that message. That prophet has spoken without my authority and need not be feared."

## The Cyrus Prophecy

## The Tyre Prophecy

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Ezekiel 26:3-4;7"
  quote="therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves. They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock...For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: From the north I am going to bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with horsemen and a great army."
/>

There is a very big problem here. Nebuchadnezzar never conquered Tyre. Nebuchadnezzar led a siege against Tyre for 13 years, but the siege ended with Tyre eventually negotiating its surrender. However, Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians never made it to the island city of Tyre and never destroyed the city.

<ScriptureQuote
  reference="Ezekiel 26:11-14"
  quote="The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea. I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more. I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread fishnets. You will never be rebuilt, for I the Lord have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord."
/>

The imagery in this prophecy plainly spells out that the Babylonians would destroy Tyre's buildings, kill their people, and steal all of their wealth. Unfortunately for this prophecy, none of this happened. Nebuchadnezzar never plundered or destroyed Tyre.

This prophecy is rather plainly stated, and the facts around the history of Tyre are undisputed even among Christian scholars, so how do we reconcile the fact that Ezekiel's prophecy about Tyre failed to come true?
